# CLASSB\_CLOCK\_TEST\_TMR1\_RATIO\_NS

**Summary**

Duration of TMR1 clock in nano seconds.

**Description**

Defines the duration of TMR1 clock in nano seconds. This is used to calculate the duration of CPU clock test in terms of TMR1 cycles.

**Remarks**

TMR1 is clocked from 32768 Hz Crystal. One TMR1 cycle is 30517 nano sec. This value must not be modified.
