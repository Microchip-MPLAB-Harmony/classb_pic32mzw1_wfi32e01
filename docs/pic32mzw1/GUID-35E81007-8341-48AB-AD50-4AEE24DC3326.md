# CLASSB\_CPU\_PCTest

**Function**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS CLASSB_CPU_PCTest(bool running_context);
```

**Summary**

This self-test checks the Program Counter register \(PC\) of the CPU, to detect stuck-at faults.

**Description**

This self-test calls multiple functions in predefined order and verifies that each function is executed and returns the expected value. If the return values of all test functions are correct, the Program Counter is assumed to be working fine.

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

*running\_context* - False for startup test. True for run-time test.

**Returns**

*CLASSB\_TEST\_STATUS* - Status of the test.

**Example**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS classb_test_status = CLASSB_TEST_NOT_EXECUTED;
// Perform run-time test of the PC
classb_test_status = CLASSB_CPU_PCTest(true);
```

**Remarks**

This self-test can be used during startup as well as run-time. If a failure is detected, this self-test remains in an infinite loop to avoid unsafe code execution.
