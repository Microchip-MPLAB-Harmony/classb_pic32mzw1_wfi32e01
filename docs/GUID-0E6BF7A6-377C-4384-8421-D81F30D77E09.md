# CLASSB\_RST\_IOTest

**Function**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS CLASSB_RST_IOTest(CLASSB_PORT_INDEX port, CLASSB_PORT_PIN pin, CLASSB_PORT_PIN_STATE state);
```

**Summary**

This self-test can be used to perform plausibility checks on IO pins.

**Description**

This self-test checks whether a given IO pin is at the expected logic state. As the exact use of an IO pin is decide by the application, it is the responsibility of the caller to configure the IO pin direction and drive the pin to the expected state before calling this self-test.

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

*port* - Index of the IO PORT. Defined by enum CLASSB\_PORT\_INDEX.

*pin* - Index of the pin on the given PORT. Defined by enum CLASSB\_PORT\_PIN.

*state* - Expected logic state of the IO pin. It can be PORT\_PIN\_LOW or PORT\_PIN\_HIGH.

**Returns**

*CLASSB\_TEST\_STATUS* - Status of the test.

**Example**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS classb_test_status = CLASSB_TEST_NOT_EXECUTED;
// Perform test of an IO pin at run-time
classb_test_status = CLASSB_RST_IOTest(PORTB, PIN31, PORT_PIN_HIGH);
```

**Remarks**

This self-test can be used only during run-time.
