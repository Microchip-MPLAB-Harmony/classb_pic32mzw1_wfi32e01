# CLASSB\_SST\_InterruptTest

**Function**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS CLASSB_SST_InterruptTest(void);
```

**Summary**

This self-test checks basic functionality of the interrupt handling mechanism.

**Description**

This self-test configures the EVIC, the TMR1 and the TMR2 peripheral to test the interrupt handling mechanism of the microcontroller. It verifies that at least one interrupt is generated and handled properly. This self-test also checks whether the number of interrupts generated are too many within a given time period. It reports a PASS if the total number of interrupts generated by the TMR2 is less than the specified upper limit and greater than one.

**Precondition**

None.

**Parameters**

None.

**Returns**

*CLASSB\_TEST\_STATUS* - Status of the test.

**Example**

```c
CLASSB_TEST_STATUS classb_test_status = CLASSB_TEST_NOT_EXECUTED;
// Perform test of the Interrupt mechanism at start-up
classb_test_status = CLASSB_SST_InterruptTest();
```

**Remarks**

This self-test can be used only during startup.
